# CLASSIFICATION OF PROGRAMMING PARADIGMS #

## PROGRAMMING PARADIGMS ##

Thery are define as method to solve some problem or do some task.

Programming paradigm is an approach to solve problem using some programming language or also we can say it is a method to solve a problem using tools and techniques that are available to us following some approach. There are lots for programming language that are known but all of them need to follow some strategy when they are implemented and this methodology/strategy is paradigms. A  programming paradigm is a style, or “way,” of programming.

#### Functional programming

Is a programming paradigm where you have a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs. Here you treat computation as an evaluation of mathematical functions and you avoid changing-state and mutable data.

#### Logic

Is a kind of imperative programming where control flow is defined by nested loops, conditionals, and subroutines, rather than via gotos. Variables are generally local to blocks (have lexical scope).

#### Data-flow Programming

Is the processes communicating with each other over predefined channels.

#### Logic (Rule-based)

Programming by specifying a set of facts and rules. An engine infers the answers to questions.

# DATA REPRESENTATION AND OPERATORS 

#### Identifiers

Identifiers are names for entities in a C program, such as variables, arrays, functions, structures, unions and labels. An identifier can be composed only of uppercase, lowercase letters, underscore and digits, but should start only with an alphabet or an underscore. If the identifier is not used in an external link process, then it is called as internal. Example: Local variable. If the identifier is used in an external link process, then it is called as external. Example: Global variable

#### variable

In programming, a variable is a value that can change, depending on conditions or on information passed to the program. Typically, a program consists of instruction s that tell the computer what to do and data that the program uses when it is running.

#### Constants

Data values that stay the same every time a program is executed are known as constants. Constants are not expected to change.

#### Reserved word

Often found in programming languages and macros, reserved words are terms or phrases appropriated for special use that may not be utilized in the creation of variable names. For example, "print" is a reserved word because it is a function in many languages to show text on the screen.

#### Primitive data type

In simple terms “data type” and “primitive data type” are simply known and used as interchangeable variables. Primitive data types are predefined types of data, which are supported by the programming language. For example, integer, character, and string are all primitive data types.

Memory space and range of values

•	Integer: Keyword used for integer data types is int. Integers typically requires 4 bytes of memory space and ranges from -2147483648 to 2147483647.

•	Character: Character data type is used for storing characters. Keyword used for character data type is char. Characters typically requires 1 byte of memory space and ranges from -128 to 127 or 0 to 255.

•	Boolean: Boolean data type is used for storing boolean or logical values. A boolean variable can store either true or false. Keyword used for boolean data type is bool.

•	Floating Point: Floating Point data type is used for storing single precision floating point values or decimal values. Keyword used for floating point data type is float. Float variables typically requires 4 byte of memory space.

•	Double Floating Point: Double Floating Point data type is used for storing double precision floating point values or decimal values. Keyword used for double floating point data type is double. Double variables typically requires 8 byte of memory space.

•	void: Void means without any value. void datatype represents a valueless entity. Void data type is used for those function which does not returns a value.

•	Wide Character: Wide character data type is also a character data type but this data type has size greater than the normal 8-bit datatype. Represented by wchar_t. It is generally 2 or 4 bytes long.

C: Composite Types

#### Composite data types 

Are user defined data types that consist of several elements grouped together. Usually data elements are stored close together in consecutive memory addresses.

There are several composite data types in C.

•	Arrays

•	Strings

•	Structures

•	Unions
